# Technology Challenges

## I Disillusionment
- Three grand stories to explain the whole past and future predict: the fascist, communist, and liberal story. Fascist story knocked out after WWII, the communist story collapsed after the cold-war, then after economy crisis 2008, people on the world have become increasingly disillusioned with the liberal story.
- "If mosquito buzzed in our ears and disturbed our sleep, we know how to kill the mosquito, but if a though buzzed in our mind and kept us awake at night, we don't know how to kill the though"
- In the revolution of infotech and biotech, political become more irrelevant. People now fear not by automation and AI, that's why people loses faith in liberal story. Liberal story was story about ordinary people, they don't have an idea about future real issue.
- In the twenty-first century, we stayed not against the economic elite that exploit people, but against that economic elite does not need us.
- No one to migrate to rusia, but to liberal country such USA, Germany and Canada. While there is more middle east youth willing to journey to liberal germany, than muslim youth around the world want to live under muslim theocracy. Faith is less severe its predecessor.
- The liberal story is buffet, no country can pick and choose their dishes, they must take them all. Then what will happen, people will embraced new one global story with *bewilderment*, humble and more clear-insight to answer biggest problem we face: ecological collapse and technology disruption. That's what Harari want to tell in this book.

## II Work
- In the past, machine compete with human mainly in raw physical abilities, human retain an immense edge over machines in cognition. AI now begin to perform human in learning, analysis, communication, while human still rely on heuristic and shortcut in decision-making process. Nowadays, AI will replacing human position.
- AI has advantages, connectivity to push new regulation (autonoumous driving) and database (medicine/disease for AI doctor). Surly AI can make a mistake, but human will have many alternative algorithm to use. This advantage bring to cheaper healthcare system, reduce the traffic accident etc. So it madness to block automation in field such as transport and healthcare in order to protect human jobs. Redundant jobs need to find something else to do.
- New created jobs for human by AI such maintenance, remote control, data analysis. Job market of 2050 might characterized by human-AI cooperation. But it will not solve the problem of unemployed. Unskilled laborers. And human-AI team will find that every routine is an invasion for disruption and every hierarchy is initiation for revolution.
- AI revolution will bring new equilibrium. Today employees expect to work in the same job for their entire life. Its nonsense. Job for life are thing of the past, lifelong learning.
- Even human can't compete with machine in workplace, human far from certain to be the only consumer. Nowadays the buyer of stock-exchange, bond are algorithm. Web designer and online editor choose to follow google search algorithm than human taste.
- Human need to invest new social economic models to protecting human rather than their jobs. Focus on providing the people basic needs and social status.
- Universal basic income (UBI) use tax to provide every person to cover his basic needs. Like $1000 program by Andrew Yang in USA lah. Instead of giving money to people, government might subsides free education, free healthcare, free transport called universal basic service (UBS); these are utopia of communism btw. So which is better, UBI or UBS?
- Universal Europe countries experiment with UBI and give the promising result. But the main viction in disruption jobs by AI are developing countries. In twentyfirst-century, developing countries will lack natural resources, selling cheap labour. With AI, cheap unskilled labor would became far less important.
- If universal safety-net have strong implemented, losing jobs to AI turn out to be blessing. What we should worry is shift in authority from human to AI. It might destroy liberal story and open to digital dictatorship.

## III Liberty
- referendum and election are always about human feeling, not human rationality. If technological ability to hack and manipulate the human heart, democratic politic will mutate into an emotional puppet show.
- When the biotech revolution merges with infotech revolution, it will produce big data algorithm that can monitor and understand human feeling much better than human themselves, the authority will shift from human to computer.
- Most people don't know themselves very well. Perhaps the algorithm show the picture of attractive man or woman, and then track your eyes movement, blood pressure and brain activity. Algorithm can tell any teenager exactly he is gay or straight. And it easy for coca-cola if it want to sell fizzy drink to specific person, better to use shirtless guy or shirtless girl. People won't even now, but they (company) will, this information will worth billion.
- Algorithm from our behavior and biometric sensor not just able to choose movie for us, but will make for us the most important decision in life; what to study, where to work, who to marry.
- Algorithm will repeatedly make mistakes due to insufficient data. But it's okay, Amazon won't have to be perfect. It will just need to better on average than us humans. It's not difficult, most people often make trouble mistakes, they suffer from muddied definition from chaos of life.
- "Big data algorithm: they have lots of hitches, but we have no better alternative."
- Hacking human decision-making will not only make big data algorithm more reliable, it will simultaneously make human feeling less reliable. As government and corporation succeed in hacking the human operating system, human will be exposed by manipulation, advertising and propaganda.
- Once AI makes better decision than us about careers and perhaps even relationship, our concept about humanity and life will be change.
- Everyday, people absorb countless data from SNS, email, article, but they don't know where they fit into great schema of life, because too busy to consume the information.
- The danger is if we invest too much in developing AI, and too little in developing human consciousness. People losing the ability to pay attention to their own meal, because busy to businesses thing while eating. People busy to expand investment portfolio, so they strive to understand the mysteries of stock exchange, while making less effort to understand the deep causes of suffering.

## IV Equality
- Why equality matter, both democratic and dictatorship government invested heavily in the health, education and welfare of the massive, because they needed millions of healthy laborers to operate the production lines and millions of loyal soldiers.
- The combination of bioengineeirng coupled with rise of AI result in people lose their economic, political power etc. Resulting inequality gap wider and concentrated in small elite.
- The ownership of data is to prevent for this. In the past, if too much land became concentrated in too few hands, society split into aristocrats and commoners. In the modern era, if too many machines concentrated in too few hands, society split into capitalist and proletariat. In twentyfirst century, when data became more important, if this commodity concentrated in too few hands, humankind will split into different species.
- Data company such google and facebook capture our attention by providing us with free information, services and entertainment. They resell the attention to advertisement. We aren't their customers, we are their product. But in the long run, the advertisement will be useless because decision making, to buy something rely on the algorithm.
- If the data mandated to government, it may result in creepy digital dictatorship. Once political press our emotional button directly, generating anxiety, hatred and joy, politics will become a more emotional circus.
- People have experience to regulate their ownership of land. We know hot to build a fence in a field, place guard at the gate and control who can go in. But we don't have experience in regulating the ownership of data yet.

# Social Challenges

## V Community
- Facebook, by their manifesto try to push how human create and identify community, by using AI to strengthen our social fabric and bring the world closer together. But most of us find it is impossible to rely more than 150 individuals. People try to regulate small groups of people with imaginary of communities called nation and political parties, but they can't provide warm intimacy. Consequently people then ever more lonely lives in an ever more connected planet.
- In the past, human could not afford such carelessness. Ancient human, forager, more always alert and and attention giver, to stay safe they must find what kind of mushrooms, listen to grass to learn whatever snake may be lurking. Today, we are luckily don't need this awareness. We can buy anything food because already supervised by health authorities. But is still ended eating in front of screen while hardly paying attention to actual taste.
- People need tool to connect to their own experience. But instant gratification "like", what we feel is increasingly determined by the other online reaction.
- Social media business model encouraged people to spend more and ore time online, means less time and energy to devote to offline activity. Human have body, therefore needs road, hospital, etc which build by tax. The online company don't see this matter important because they accused by tax evasion.
- Some devices such google glass and pokemon go try to bridging between online and offline . Deeper, with biometric sensor, once the tech-giant came to human body, they might end up manipulating our entire bodies in the some way they currently manipulate our eyes, fingers and credit card.  

## VI Civilization
- Revolutionary is about story telling skill. People, often refuse to see the changes the revolutionary, especially when it comes to core political and religious values.
- Humankind was divided into countless isolated tribes, then fused into larger and larger groups, creating fewer distinct civilization. The unification process itself taken by establishing links between distinct groups and homogenizing practices across groups links may be formed even between groups that behave differently, like enemies band by war.
- Now, people agree on sigh political paradigm have general diplomatic protocol on common international laws. Even the national anthem, almost the same throughout the world, indicating common conception of politics and groups of loyalty. When watching Olimpiade, there is more pride than national delegation win a medal, that's humankind is capable of organizing such an event.
- A thousand years ago, every culture had its own stay about the universe, but today the world believe exactly the same understand about matter, energy, time and space. People have different religious and national identities. But when it comes to practical stuff, all of us belong to the same civilization.
- Talking about big challenge when global nature, we  will have huge arguments and conflicts are not isolate us with on another. They will make us ever more interdependent. We are members of a single global civilization.
