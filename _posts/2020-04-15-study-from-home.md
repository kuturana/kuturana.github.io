Since COVID-19 still breaks the community, the campus closed their gate for the student came to the building. Suppose will be open again after annual long holiday goldenweek. As a good student and foreigner resident, there no need to resist. Study from home for a month sounds nice. Then the challenge, is to change the habit to more adapt for stay productive, at home.

Since long time ago, I set my room as place for leisure, sleep, cook purpose only. Nonetheless, there is a study desk, mostly I use for take late dinner or multipurpose ironing desk every Monday morning. I'm good enough to separate between ~~work~~ study related and leisure purpose. Never bring my *machine* and notebook before. There are bunch of books at home but none of them relates to my research haha. I even stock only tea at home, and coffee at lab.

Then to push new habit, the clue is the important one to recirculate clue-routine-reward loop [1]. How to behave with same manner but with different place. Start with take the shower and breakfast at same time as before. Sounds crazy but I use shirt and pant as I came to campus lately. Make a list for target should be done in this month and breakdown into daily, and use getting-things-done checklist as the reward. Totally same as my daily activity at campus. There is no obstacles yet, and to make it remarkable, lets set *Stars and Rabbit - Rainbow Aisle* as main theme for this quarantine time. Commit.
