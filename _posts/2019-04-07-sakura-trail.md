Normally people are enjoying sakura, or we call hanami, with gathered in some park, take a seat on a *terpal*, open the bento or beer and have a chit chat with relative. This time we enjoyed with a trail. Around twenty kilometers, along the canal. This trail started from Kawaramachi, walked through the Biwako Canal and ended at well-known Philosopher Path.
