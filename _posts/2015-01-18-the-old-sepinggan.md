I take this picture when arrived at Balikpapan for this holiday. I bored to waiting for mini bus that will take me to Sangatta, then I walked to  building on the side the airport. Ya that's the old sepinggan building. There's no activity at there because all airport functionality has moved to the new building. But sometimes security walk over there. The old building has a good design that figure borneo art. Like the pilars with characteristic borneo pattern.
