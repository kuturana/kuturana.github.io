It was yesterday when I had bimonthly and for the last time this year to back-up the files on my devices. I've realized the photos I took during autumn was never shared anywhere. We did a lot of hiking this autumn, like every weekend had a space for doing outdoor activity near the city. Autumn is great, the weather is comfy, and the end of autumn is scenic with its color. Japan has their own word for this, 紅葉 (kōyō).
