title:  "In Finding Enjoyment without Fame"
---

To find enjoyment in life, an individual must pursue their destiny as human. Someone says their destiny is to be an architect, an engineer, a politician, a  teacher, or whatever they fill they fit into it. While others don't even know their destiny, stoic said it more in general: the destiny as a human is as simple as useful for other fellows human [^1]. This, to attain a valuable life in a simple manner, people mistakenly pursue something that makes them unhappy, fame. The reason why fame isn't valuable based on the social status we seek will give other people power over us; make it our goal to please others, but we will no longer have the freedom to please ourselves. Then in the same stoic philosophy, we will have enslaved ourselves to attain fame.

In modern life with more technology interference, it's easier to gain fame, beings who can't ever completely ignore what other people think. With instant gratification, people may lose their value in finding enjoyment [^2]. Taking the example when I fall in love with photography in the same era when Instagram introduced to the android environment. My styles and tone then defined and developed based on the numbers of likes I got for each post. Unconsciously, I shifted the goal of doing photography to produce the photo that I assumed will amplify the likes. Then when I posted a photo where the number of likes is few, even I think the photo was good, I felt unsatisfied. My goal of doing photography to attain enjoyment was deceased. But it makes me realize that doing that Instagram things for photography hobby is worthless; ended with posting the photos nowhere but here.

Neglecting fame also restore the foundation of learning. It was convinced by Einstein's turning point when he worked at the patent office after graduated. Without any professor to impress, no university administrator to placate, no student to whom he had justified his existence, he still produces the magnificent seminal paper [^3]. This period became the time where his love of learning is put to the test, freedom to nurture natural curiosity. So, it's a mistake to understand that enjoyment of learning should be promoted by a sense of duty, moreover a sense of gaining fame.

We should do something in a manner of enjoyment without conceiving any possibility of getting fame. It foolish for us to worry about what other people think of us; particularly foolish for us to seek the approval of the people. Like Ross and Phoebe on *Friends* who still play their music even their friends didn't accept it. Like Adams on *Patch Adams* pursue the medical degree because he enjoys helping the sick people, even his school in beginning banned him to enter the ward. Or like Heinrich on *7 years in Tibet* who still aim to hike Nanga Partbat, even the mission was abolished.
