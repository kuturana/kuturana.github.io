Since been studying the Ergonomics on the desk, how the human perform their work always interests me on the daily life. I like to take the first car to see the train driver do their work on complex console, or simply to see the shop clerk scanning the things at the supermarket, the guys at udon store handling and serving that delicate noodle; the cognitive and physical ability conflated in conformable manner. Sure, as an engineering student, I always consider how these things should go in efficient. But, how really their perception about the work? Did she or he enjoy, let say one third of the day? The folks like to say "hidup hanya sekali" to endorse of their philosophy of hedonism, as they work to get income to maximize this pleasure on the vigorous life start from Friday night, and again grumble at Monday morning. Why, not do the work who get the pleasure instead? I myself still wondering, the one who enjoy their work are the luckiest they are.
