title:  "The Readitis"
---

After finishing the first manuscript, I back to the old good bad practice, the readitis. Sounds like some disease infects your organs. In nature article, it's defined as the habits of reading endlessly to gain the self-belief that it will make ready enough to start writing. Yet in the opposite, it often makes less likely to write, and badly more confused.

For me, this habit falls to defer the experiment itself. Like I don't have enough understanding about the background, the methodology is still lack, the post-hoc analysis is ambiguous, or experimental setup isn't ready. It's true that this problem due to the technical issues. But the readitis has made it worse. Until one day may supervisor told me to start the experiment. Read the literature is a must, but we need some results to study, just do the experiment.

It almost stopped, just after we got the results. But to start writing the report is straitened hard. Feels like I need one more paper to read before making my own words. Just one after another paper has been read. After higlighting some key sentence. After finding a new reference book in the library. The write itself was postponed until several days, one weeks, two weeks... Until the powerful, last, horrify deadline was coming.

The readitis also can be interpreted as a feeling of amount literature available, but we have little spare time to absorb it. It directs to download more and more papers. This condition will end with a bunch of pdf files in the download folder or reference apps, not sorted and unread. Sometimes in free time, you realize and ask, why I have this report before? And try so hard to link it to the recent project.

Although this habit is bad for research life, I tend to not stop it. Instead, I enjoy it
