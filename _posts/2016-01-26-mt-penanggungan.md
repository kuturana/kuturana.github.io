So here the story. This's the first impression for me to hike a mountain. Influenced by the Indonesian movie "Soe Hok Gie", I always want to hike a mountain someday. The first mountain that I hiked was Mt. Penanggungan. Cakra tells this mountain is the best choice for who never hiking before.

Actually the plan for this trip was come the day before when Cakra invite us at Laboratory to go out for holiday. And we choose to hike Mt. Penanggungan even we only have one day to prepare everything. The team for this trip was Katil, Danang, Cakra, Manuel and me.

The plan was two days trip. We went to Trawas at 12.00 PM Saturday afternoon and start to hike at 15.00 PM. We arrived at Bukit Bayang at 18.00 and set up a camp there. After break for sleep and eat, we continue too hike at 02.00 AM Sunday morning and reach the top of Mt. Penanggungan at 04.00 AM so we can see the sunrise. After two hours at alp, we go down at 07.00 AM and arrived the first post at 13.00 PM.

It was tired trip because this the first time for me, and the track so slippery because rainy season. But actually we really enjoy it. Many people say with go hike together you will know how is your friend. And you will be close to friend with hiking because you  have fun, eat, and sleep together.
