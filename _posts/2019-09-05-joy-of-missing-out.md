title:  "Joy of Missing Out"
---

I've been living without social media for almost one year half, and I enjoy it. Someone said I'm crazy, the other guess I was dead. It's difficult at the first time when deactive the account. Two times reactivated the account is enough for me before decided to permanently delete them. It feels so relieved. And for sure, one that I can be proud of, haha.

One term that I just know from podcast I used to listen. Instead of *fear of missing out*, another person tend to *joy of missing out*. Am I one of them? Not so. But after turned off my accounts, it brought positive vibe. More books in the process, more activity done, more cleaner rooms, and the upmost is more *santuy*. You don't have to know everything. You can stop to compare your life with your friends. And you can finish something with less pressure because you don't need thats all exposure and complement ~~except research~~.

But sometimes I admit it made awkward moments when my new friends want to tag me on their instastories and they shout "You do the photography for hoby but don't have ig account?". Or when I didn't realize  my high school friend have their first baby and the respond was "Err, don't you see her timeline?". Or several time I can't relate some chitchat with friends about trending videos or gossips and most my question at first is "*artis* who?". It succefully made a strange impression and they might think I'm the one who still life in the cave without internet.

But ya, life is more precious and many things to explore and learn than knowing whats our friend eat for her dinner, what song she likes to listen, or unnecessary *sambatan* every day. It just enough. It's not necessery to know what everyone think about an issue. Just read the fact, and build your own opinion, that's all.

For sure, you can enjoy your missing out without deactive the social media. Just put that damn phone down for a while and enjoy your life.
