There's nothing special with the sunset in in winter. Even the red and orange color should be longer because the Rayleigh scattering in less humidity atmosphere, I can't notice from my laboratory window every dusk. One occasion, we headed to the beach to see this sunset that came slower after the solstice. It's beautiful, perhaps because I rarely see the sunset. Then I remember in "Sepotong Senja.." by SGA, the lover cut the sunset and put it in the envelope. Surely it's not necessary this time.
