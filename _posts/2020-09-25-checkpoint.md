Japan's flag _Hinomaru_ was flying when I entered the campus gate this morning.  Today, it's been half of the journey since I started this "pilgrim" three years ago. I used this post as a reminder for myself, the next three years' journey will be more mentally demanding, more challenging, lots of pressure, and surprise on the way. That I must enjoy and flourish every event in this time span. I should, instead of omitting the "ngeyelan" character, must embrace the argument with valid evidence. Just remember to be a student is to be guided. Thus, use the last part of this journey to gain the capability to be a frontier and intellectual mindset. Before wherever I will do the research after graduate. Prepare, and get ready.
